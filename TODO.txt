COMPLETE
~~~~~~~~
[x] snazzy name = flashback (was greenback, was sheevabackup)
[x] config files (global, per machine, per share)
[x] use rsync instead of rsback
[x] rotate backups myself
[x] plug-in to allow LED blinking
[x] store status in a file
[x] debian package
[x] push to github
[x] second-level backups
[x] top-level config file - change from import to config format
[x] top-level config file - move to /etc
[x] config file - allow comments
[x] config file - user-defined "topdir"
[x] config file - default cycle times, labels
[x] rsyncOpts does not work
[x] when ping fails, set status to NOTFOUND, not FAILED


TO DO
~~~~~
[ ] write summary info to a per-backup status/history file (sqlite?)
[ ] bug?? : failures (half-copies) still update daily.1 timestamp
[ ] debian package installs monitor.sh in examples
[ ] test start/stop/install/uninstall
[ ] document - main config file options, overriding options in specific sub-config files
[ ] document - how to install (if you're not on a debian system)


CONSIDER
~~~~~~~~
consider ssh options >> StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
consider client keys using >> from="sheeva.home.alanporter.com",no-pty


LATER
~~~~~
deduplication - audit runs after backup, compares "new" and "large" files to yesterday's large files, compares md5, creates hard links
